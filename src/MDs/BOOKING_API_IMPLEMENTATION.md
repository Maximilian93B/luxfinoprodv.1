# Booking API Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation steps for the Booking API system, including routes, validation, authentication, and additional features.

## 1. Core API Routes

### Base Routes (`/api/bookings/route.ts`)
- **GET** `/api/bookings`
  - Query params: `id`, `startDate`, `endDate`
  - Returns: Single booking or filtered list
- **POST** `/api/bookings`
  - Supports: LUX_PICNICS, LUX_REMOTE, LUX_CATERING
  - Handles payment link creation via Square

### Individual Booking Routes (`/api/bookings/[id]/route.ts`)
- **GET** `/api/bookings/:id`
  - Returns: Detailed booking information
- **PATCH** `/api/bookings/:id`
  - Updates booking status
  - Validates status enum values

## 2. Input Validation


## 3. Security & Performance

### Middleware Implementation
- API Key authentication
- Rate limiting with Upstash Redis
- Request logging
- Error handling

## 4. Database Schema

### Key Models

## Security Considerations
Currently, the API is protected by:
- API key authentication
- Rate limiting
- Basic error handling

Additional security needed:
- User authentication (JWT/Session)
- Role-based access control
- Input sanitization
- Enhanced error logging
